# React-Group-Project-Prep

Welcome to the React Final Group Project! 
 
Teamwork is vital to any successful developer and this assignment is meant to ensure you're ready to collaborate effectively and make the most of this experience.  

Keep in mind that group work is not working together as a group on one feature.  

Group work means delegating responsibility between team members and meating agreed upon deadlines.  

## Assignment Requirements

Your prep assignment submission should include the following components.  Remember, this work can and should be split amongst team members:

### 1. Trello Board
Create a Trello board that includes all project members (including instructors). Use the board to outline your project plan, tasks, and progress. This will serve as a dynamic tool for task management and collaboration.  Invite your instructional team as collaborators on this board.

### 2. Component Architecture
Diagram your component architecture. Clearly define how components will interact, including how state and props will flow. This visual representation will help you better understand the structure of your application.  Invite your instructional team as collaborators on this document.

### 3. Wireframes
Develop wireframes for both mobile and desktop views. Consider different screen sizes for tablets, desktops, and phones. This will guide your UI design and ensure a consistent user experience across devices.  Invite your instructional team as collaborators on this document.

### 4. Group Norms
Establish a set of group norms that outline how you'll communicate, make decisions, and handle conflicts. Clear norms will enhance collaboration and create a positive working environment.  This is a contract that you will all agree upon to work together on this project.  It should include

* When we will meet during the weekend to work
* How we choose to communicate - Slack? Email?
* Deliverables - what is each team member responsible for delivering over the weekends and in class time?

Read and discuss [Working in Groups](./working-in-groups.md)

Use this [worksheet to help establish your team norms](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/the-real-world-guide-to-team-norms/).

Invite your instructional team as collaborators on this document.

### 5. GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub repository for your project. Make sure to include all team members as collaborators. This will be your central hub for version control and collaborative coding.  Select one fellow to create and manage this repository.   Make sure this repository is public and shared with your instructional team. 

Keep in mind it is the expectation that every team member contribute a Pull Request to the main repository and git history will be monitored to see who is contributing what code.


### 6. Delegated Tasks
Assign specific tasks to each team member. Define roles and responsibilities, ensuring everyone has a clear understanding of their contributions. This will foster efficient teamwork and individual accountability. Each task should detail a  User Story that explains a desired feature.  Each member of the team must be assigned at least one user story to work on over the course of the project.


## Deliverables

### Planning Documents
Planning documents for this project are due by ***End of Day 9/11*** 

Submit relevant links on Canvas under the React Group Project Project Prep

### Stand Up 
Each team must schedule a stand-up with their instructor to take place during class on 9/17.  
It is the responsibility of each team to proactively communicate when they would like this meeting to occur.  
During this stand up each teammember must describe:
* What features they have been working on 
* What Blockers (if any) they are facing
* The next feature they intend on building

### Fellow Reviews
Each member of the team will be responsible for reviewing their teammates by filling out the teamwork rubric located below.
