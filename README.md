# Welcome to the React Final Group Project!

Teamwork is vital to any successful developer and this assignment is meant to ensure you're ready to collaborate effectively and make the most of this experience.

Keep in mind that group work is not working together as a group on one feature.

Group work means delegating responsibility between team members and meating agreed upon deadlines.

Our teams’ group norms include maintaining lines of communication with the various team members via slack. ‘Not going ghost’ is important to maintain group coordination. We will meet once a night if possible for 1-2 hours this week. Each member is responsible for helping code the app components and making sure everything works.

## 6. GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub repository for your project. Make sure to include all team members as collaborators. This will be your central hub for version control and collaborative coding. Select one fellow to create and manage this repository. Make sure this repository is public and shared with your instructional team. Keep in mind it is the expectation that every team member contribute a Pull Request to the main repository and git history will be monitored to see who is contributing what code.

This will foster efficient teamwork and individual accountability. Each task should detail a User Story that explains a desired feature. Each member of the team must be assigned at least one user story to work on over the course of the project.

For the most part its going to be a collaborative effort, we will be helping each other code while being in the same study rooms. We will deligate the following minor task to each individual: Mikal - Design James - Routes Alexander - API Fetch Erick - basic app structure
